### Takeaways from Finishing Remaining BMVP (Beyond Minimum Viable Product), Expo elevator pitch, and in-class presentation

#### During the past weeks, I successfully completed my MVP with Michaela that includes our website and our final simulation using Babylon as well as our presenation from Finishing Remaining MVP (Beyond Minimum Viable Product), Expo elevator pitch, and in-class presentation. Therefore, I will talk about my takeaways, Skills, EDP, professionalism, as well as links to our sources of our notes and slides. 

#### Even though I and Michaela successfuly finished our minimum viable product, my job was to make our wesbite interactive and more visual like modern websites but it was still lacking imgaes, missing attractive features, and more texture along with more babylon since we wanted to make our website professional. 
###### Background

``` JS

    const backgroundLayer = new BABYLON.Layer("backgroundLayer", "white.jpg", scene, true); //use img as background

<img src="BLOOD3.jpg" style="width:50%" class="center">>
```

Analysis: In this spacific case, we were fixing our website with final touches since our website had limited Use of Images. Even though we had few images for our product, we literally had nothing visual or interactive for our background website so the visual appeal could be enhanced by more high-quality or illustrations of brain which is what I did. I set the background image using a Layer which doesn't overlap 3D model with image of brain. Therefore, our website was better with final touches and more visual and interactive background to get attention of our audience once they look at our website.


###### Presenting Our Product

We found many difficulties in trying to plan our presentation to both the class and in the expo. These issues stemmed from mainly miscommunication and the lacking ability to find proper connections between our assigned roles.

Analysis: Ultimately, we had to clearly communicate to each other our progress and make clear what role we were committing to. We did this through assigned slides which helped us the most in determining our connections and differences in formulating an overall product. Being able to identify our standpoints helped us to clearly connect our combined efforts throughout this project and tie that progress back to our primary goal and aspirations.

No Interactive Features: There are no interactive elements like animations, hover effects, transitions, or user-driven interactions such as forms or dynamic content updates.

### Engineering Design Process

I've reached the end of my EDP, where I'm now on the final step of the process, and I'm communicating my results. I've already shared and will continue to share the final product with my peers for feedback which I can take advantage of for future projects. I plan to utilize this feedback in a general sense where I can apply it during my classes, to my schedule, and to my general life both in and out of school. Feedback I've received so far includes adding onto my project and building onto my goal which I will try to achieve but on a less strict schedule as I also want to pursue other projects. When I do begin to add onto my project, I want to try implementing animations into my simulation to make it more lively. 

### Skills

Referring back to the miscommunication my partner and I experienced when planning to present our project, a skill I was able to reflect on was communication. During this time in our process, it was crucial we knew where the other party was at being that we had to tie in all our progress to our initial goal from the beginning of the year to the end. To do this, we were made to recollect and learn the information each of us possessed and exchange. By working on this exchange of information, I was able to effectively communicate outside of school as well especially when relaying information to my family. With the implementation of this process I'm able to better plan events with my family and friends specifically for this upcoming summer. Another skill I was able to reflect on is gathering information. With presentation planning came presentation topics. My partner and I had to know what was and wasn't relevant in our presentation to effectively communicate our goal and the process attached to that goal to our audience. To achieve this, we, again, exchanged each other's knowledge and also revisited past projects/blogs to gather pivotal moments in our freedom project journey. By doing this, I was able to integrate this skill of gathering information into other classes, especially my chemistry class where I'm currently researching acid-base solutions alongside molecular shapes. Effective researching has helped me become knowledgeable on these topics through the related process I used from an unrelated class. I will continue to utilize this skill to conduct further research in my chemistry class to be able to eventually formulate another final MVP.  

### Reflection

I look forward to using the skills I have been able to recently reflect on in my final Chemistry project.

Limited Use of Images: While you have a couple of images (BLOOD3.jpg, BLOOD2.png), the visual appeal could be enhanced by more high-quality, relevant graphics, icons, or illustrations.
No Interactive Features: There are no interactive elements like animations, hover effects, transitions, or user-driven interactions such as forms or dynamic content updates.
