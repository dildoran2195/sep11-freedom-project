## Why The Medicine Technology Process?

The topic that I have chosen for the year-long project is **The Medicine Technology Process** and my tool is **Babylon**. I chose this topic because I love to study different kinds of the technology of med and the process of making it. I am obsessed with the different styles of technologies for medicine and want to know more about it, especially all kinds of new style ones. There are plenty of technology of medicine including robotics, AI, Health administrations, Health wearables, and bioprinting which all are medical technology that can be defined as the technologies that diagnose, treat and/or improve a person's health and wellbeing. These technologies are like magical because they are able to save ones live in modern world. Also, I´m working with Michaela who is also passionate about technology of medicine and I´m very happy to work with her because we have same goal for this FP which is to do our best. Lastly, my tool for my backup project idea is Vue and my idea is probabyly Med instructive gallery. 

The two main links that I used to explore was [Medical Technology Facts](https://www.lifechanginginnovation.org/medical-technology-facts.html) and [Benefits Of Medical Technology: What's the Impact?](https://blog.cloudticity.com/benefits-of-medical-technology). The first link helps me know what the field medical technology is. Also, the second link tells me avantages of medical technology. Some other links that I had explored were [15 Tech Tools And Processes That Are Transforming The Healthcare Industry](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/31/15-tech-tools-and-processes-that-are-transforming-the-healthcare-industry/) and [25 Different Types of Medical Assistant Equipment](https://medassisting.org/medical-assistant-equipment-a-comprehensive-guide/). These two were links that helped me understand the intro of medicine proess and what were devices/technology that were helpful in medical field.

## EDP

Now, I am on the (Step 1) defining and the (Step 2) researching step of the EDP (engineering design process). At first, we were defining what we are most passionate about. Then, we do more deep research in the field that we are more passionate about and do more research about the technology that is used in that career. For instance, some technologies that were used in the field of architecture are “3D printers, augmented writing, and virtual reality.” I think I'll be on step 2 for a while before I move on to the next step of brainstorming possible solutions.

## Skills
I gained 3 skills: Communication, How to Google, and How to read

One skill that I learned during this experience is **How to Google**. I say this because in this part of the project, we were able to use Google and do different research for different technologies in different fields of careers. When I looked up "architecture innovations," I found a lot of cool stuff, but it wasn't necessarily technology. A lot of it was design-related, such as repurposing shipping containers for things like gardens or homes. So I had to add the word "technology" to my search and that really helped me confirm that I'm interested in existing and also future technology of architecture.

Another skill that I also achieved was **How to Read**. After googling, we needed to see which article matches with the topic by reading closely. There were a lot of terms I didn't know, such as "CAD" (which I then Googled, and that ties into my first skill. By the way, it means "computer aided design"). But reading an article is a lot different than reading a novel. A lot of articles have headings and subheadings that break up the text into smaller chunks, making it easier to read. I think that also helps me in the way that I write, for example, I added headings to this blog entry so that hopefully it's easier for you to read!

## Summary

Overall, I'm really excited to make a website about the technology of architecture. It all started with the inspiration of a restaurant in Fort Hamilton, and maybe I'll have a future career in architecture!
