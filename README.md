# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Dildora

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study Babylon in order to help me make Medical Simulation. Content and Purpose of this blog is to share my opinions, positive and negative impacts, and goal of our medical simulation of 3D blood analyzer a blood testing machine could potentially look like. The advanced blood analyzer machine we’re developing builds upon traditional blood pressure monitors by incorporating a suite of sensors and intelligent systems designed to capture and interpret a wide range of biological data from a single blood sample or continuous monitoring. Unlike standard devices that only measure systolic and diastolic pressure, this analyzer uses microfluidic technology to process blood in small volumes with high precision. It integrates biosensors capable of detecting and quantifying biomarkers such as glucose, cholesterol, hormones, and proteins, along with indicators of inflammation, oxygen saturation, and even early signs of disease.

## Pros
<li> This website can be useful for anyone to get diagnosed with their blood </li>
<li> Also, it shows past to future development of medicine </li>
<li> Advanced blood tester: By considering blood as a first step into the progression of medicine and technology, we'll be able to shift into other crucial prototypes </li>
<li> Our website could gave an idea or general prorotype of how medical technology could be improved moving on</li>
<li> Our product is an improved version of this where the monitor will be able to measure other factors pertaining to blood using automation to complexify the process of anaylizing concentration, cell characterization, protein and hormonal levels, etc</li>
<li> Our website aims to provide a more comprehensive snapshot of a person’s health in real time, minimizing the need for multiple separate tests and reducing delays in diagnosis.</li>
<li> Our product can continuously track and interpret various blood metrics, alerting users and healthcare providers to potential abnormalities instantly. </li>
<li>Our website does not only empowers individuals to take charge of their health but also supports doctors with more precise and up-to-date data, ultimately contributing to faster intervention and more personalized treatment plans. </li>

## Cons
<li> Our product is not interactive, it is just for people to see and learn from it </li>
<li> Our website could be more with more colors and images</li>
<li> This is just general idea of what can be done for medical development but it isn't real</li>
<li> Since, we finished our website in last minute, we could have make it better by adding more texture and more functions so it would be much better</li>
