#### I used [Babylon](https://www.babylonjs.com/), went to Tools and chose [a playground](https://playground.babylonjs.com/) to tinker with. I wondered what would happen if I change 0.7 of light density of 0.11 because I wasn´t sure of what light density is and after i did that I learned light density is the amount of color in a playground that has only a sphere. I didn't like the shape of the sphere because it was so common so I used this code 

```

// Our built-in 'goldenberg' shape. var sphere = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateGoldberg("Goldenberg", {diameter: 2, segments: 32}, scene); // Move the goldenberg upward 1/2 its height sphere.position.y = 1;

```

#### This code changed the shape of sphere to Goldenberg (name of the shape).

#### To create the shape of Goldenberg because it´s name was just fancy. 

#### In the future, I wish to work with numbers and learn more of new shapes on a sandbox on [Babylon website](https://www.babylonjs.com/) that I don´t know of yet.
