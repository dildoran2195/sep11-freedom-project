## Why architecture?

The topic that I have chosen for the year-long project is **The Medicine Technology Process** and my tool is **Babylon**. I chose this topic because I love to study different kinds of the technology of med and the process of making it. I am obsessed with the different styles of technologies for medicine and want to know more about it, especially all kinds of old style ones. ....There is a Hot-Pot Restaurant in Fort Hamilton, and the design of the restaurant looked awesome. It is one of those kinds of Chinese old style designs. I liked to see how the architecture over there plans these things out and know the process of architecturing and what kinds of technologies they use to do these beautiful architectures. Lastly, my two backup ideas are educational and graphic designs. 

The two main links that I used to explore was [10 Signs That You Should Become an Architect](https://www.mymove.com/home-inspiration/decoration-design-ideas/signs-that-you-should-become-an-architect/#:~:text=Being%20an%20architect%20is%20more,important%2C%20the%20ability%20to%20design.) and [How Technology Is Transforming Architectural Design](https://www.alvarezdiazvillalon.com/how-technology-is-transforming-architectural-design). The first link helps me know what the field architecture is. And the second link tells me what technologies are used in the field of Architecture. Some other links that I had explored were [What Tools Does an Architect Use?](https://work.chron.com/tools-architect-use-10408.html) and [25 Tools and Devices for Architects — Journey of an Architect](https://www.journeyofanarchitect.com/blog/25-tools-and-devices-for-architects). These two were links that helped me understand the intro of architecturing and what were devices/technology that were helpful in architecture. 

## EDP

Now, I am on the (Step 1) defining and the (Step 2) researching step of the EDP (engineering design process). At first, we were defining what we are most passionate about. Then, we do more deep research in the field that we are more passionate about and do more research about the technology that is used in that career. For instance, some technologies that were used in the field of architecture are “3D printers, augmented writing, and virtual reality.” I think I'll be on step 2 for a while before I move on to the next step of brainstorming possible solutions.

## Skills

One skill that I learned during this experience is **How to Google**. I say this because in this part of the project, we were able to use Google and do different research for different technologies in different fields of careers. When I looked up "architecture innovations," I found a lot of cool stuff, but it wasn't necessarily technology. A lot of it was design-related, such as repurposing shipping containers for things like gardens or homes. So I had to add the word "technology" to my search and that really helped me confirm that I'm interested in existing and also future technology of architecture.

Another skill that I also achieved was **How to Read**. After googling, we needed to see which article matches with the topic by reading closely. There were a lot of terms I didn't know, such as "CAD" (which I then Googled, and that ties into my first skill. By the way, it means "computer aided design"). But reading an article is a lot different than reading a novel. A lot of articles have headings and subheadings that break up the text into smaller chunks, making it easier to read. I think that also helps me in the way that I write, for example, I added headings to this blog entry so that hopefully it's easier for you to read!

## Summary

Overall, I'm really excited to make a website about the technology of architecture. It all started with the inspiration of a restaurant in Fort Hamilton, and maybe I'll have a future career in architecture!
