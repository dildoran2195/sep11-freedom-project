### Content: Takeaways from Finishing Remaining BMVP (Beyond Minimum Viable Product), Expo elevator pitch, and in-class presentation

#### During the past weeks, I successfully completed my BMVP with Michaela that includes our website and our final simulation using Babylon as well as our presenation from Finishing Remaining MVP (Beyond Minimum Viable Product), Expo elevator pitch, and in-class presentation. Therefore, I will talk about my takeaways, Skills, EDP, professionalism, as well as links to our sources of our notes and slides. 

#### Even though I and Michaela successfuly finished our minimum viable product, my job was to make our wesbite interactive and more visual like modern websites but it was still lacking imgaes, missing attractive features, and more texture along with more babylon since we wanted to make our website professional. 
###### No Interactive Features for Finishing Remaining BMVP (Beyond Minimum Viable Product)

``` JS

    const backgroundLayer = new BABYLON.Layer("backgroundLayer", "white.jpg", scene, true); //use img as background

Analysis: In this spacific case, we were fixing our website with final touches since our website had limited Use of Images. Even though we had few images for our product, we literally had nothing visual or interactive for our background website so the visual appeal could be enhanced by more high-quality or illustrations of brain which is what I did. I set the background image using a Layer which doesn't overlap 3D model with image of brain. Therefore, our website was better with final touches and more visual and interactive background to get attention of our audience once they look at our website.

Takeaway: Finishing Remaining BMVP (Beyond Minimum Viable Product) gave us takeaway of never over prascinating at last minute because we supposed to make our final touches days before its due date. However, we were still able to make our website more visual, interactive, high quality of brain illustration for our background which is much better than before. Therefore, it is always better to never give up even at last minute by using that 15 minutes wisely to improve with feedbacks from our classmates which they comment that it wasn't any new website so they recommended us to add more features to make it a little bit unique than before.


###### Expo elevator pitch, and in-class presentation

My challenge was not learning from my failure when our product and website was still lacking attarctive features so we had trouble with collaboration during both the class and in the expo to explain why our BMVP was not attarctive as others. Also, during preseantion we were not ready for random choice from Mr.Mueller in order to explain our challenges with Babylon and how it all intersects with our takeaways since it was pretty difficult to intersect Babylon with Java or anything in between since Bbaylon is completely different tool with combination of different features and textures.

Takeaways: Finally,I had connection between my partner and I but we had troible learning from our mistakes and priotizing time in order to practice our preseantion along with doing our BMVP on time in both the class and in expo. However, this taught us to never give up by doing our assigned tasks no matter what happens to make our product and website attarctive which we did. Therefore, communication and collaboration is a key to success by descising our challenges and linking them back to our takeaways duing all of oyr presenation. Supporting each other of us and never giving up at any points clearly helped us to combine our mistakes in order to com eup with solutions which successfully resulted in our goal along with making our friendship even more stronger than before through BMVP.

### Engineering Design Process

I am so proud of myself for being on the final step of the process but I am still in process with communicating my results by thinking of skills I've learned from BMVP. Since, we finished our presentation I still look forward to share my product and wesbite with my peers on 2026 channel on Slack in order to gather feedbacks for my APCSP and my future projects. These feedbacks defintely going to gteach me a skill by telling how I can fix my mistakes which would be heloful for my senior year, general life, and college. Since I look forward to show this project to my college application and I wnat to major in medicine so there is a huge connection between my future goals and my BMVP of 2025. Therefore, adding attractive features and textures to our product and wesbite is still on motion because we want to communicate our results of BMVP of 2025 in order to make our simulation even better to show it off to college and to ou families. Communicating our results is significnat as it helps me to plan my future goals by seeing how good I am right now and how I can improve myself in he future by thinking of what prohets I look forward to complete along with how I will achieve live and animated simulation with my partner.

### Skills: Embracing failure & Time management: prioritizing and scheduling tasks, working towards an MVP, etc.

I gained skill of embracing failure which basically means rather than being discouraged by a bug or an error message, we love mistakes because they help us learn. My mistake of over proscinating our product by not adding attractive features earlier, I learned to embrace my failure by promising myself to never do this again and to nevr give up no matter what. Also, it was my fault for not practicing my and my partners chllanges and how it all intersects with our takeaways so I learned to always have a practice before our failure in order to have successful presentation during both the class and in expo. By doing this, we were able to get 100/100 on our preseantion and BMVP so I am always proud for making mistakes intead of ebing embrassed of them since everything I fail in SEP had a purpose of looking forward to not repat the same step for next year (APCSP). Therefore, mistakes is always a key to success especially during partnetship because we were able to tell what we have to improve for our product and presenation so we took notes on posted to remind ourself of what we should say and what we should avoid during our presenataion.  I will continue to use this skill to deside further tasks in my AP Biology class since we also have presenation so I will practive my notes and record myself along with imporving anything I need to before its deadline in order to not repeat my failure or mistakes over again but I am never embarraseed of my mistakes since I also have an opportunity to fail during project.

Another skill I was able to reflect on is gathering information. With presentation planning came presentation topics. My partner and I had to know what was and wasn't relevant in our presentation to effectively communicate our goal and the process attached to that goal to our audience. To achieve this, we, again, exchanged each other's knowledge and also revisited past projects/blogs to gather pivotal moments in our freedom project journey. By doing this, I was able to integrate this skill of gathering information into other classes, especially my chemistry class where I'm currently researching acid-base solutions alongside molecular shapes. Effective researching has helped me become knowledgeable on these topics through the related process I used from an unrelated class. I will continue to utilize this skill to conduct further research in my chemistry class to be able to eventually formulate another final MVP.  

### Reflection

I look forward to using the skills I have been able to recently reflect on in my final Chemistry project.
