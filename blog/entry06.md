### Content: Takeaways from Finishing Remaining BMVP (Beyond Minimum Viable Product), Expo elevator pitch, and in-class presentation

#### During the past weeks, I successfully completed my BMVP with Michaela that includes our website and our final simulation using Babylon as well as our presentation from Finishing Remaining MVP (Beyond Minimum Viable Product), Expo elevator pitch, and in-class presentation. Therefore, I will talk about my takeaways, Skills, EDP, professionalism, as well as links to our sources of our notes and slides. 

#### Even though I and Michaela successfully finished our minimum viable product, my job was to make our website interactive and more visual like modern websites but it was still lacking images, missing attractive features, and more texture along with more babylon since we wanted to make our website professional. 
###### No Interactive Features for Finishing Remaining BMVP (Beyond Minimum Viable Product)

``` JS

    const backgroundLayer = new BABYLON.Layer("backgroundLayer", "white.jpg", scene, true); //use img as background

<img src="BLOOD3.jpg" style="width:50%" class="center">>

Analysis: In this specific case, we were fixing our website with final touches since our website had limited Use of Images. Even though we had few images for our product, we literally had nothing visual or interactive for our background website so the visual appeal could be enhanced by more high-quality or illustrations of the brain which is what I did. I set the background image using a Layer which doesn't overlap the 3D model with the image of the brain. Therefore, our website was better with final touches and more visual and interactive background to get the attention of our audience once they look at our website.

Takeaway: Finishing Remaining BMVP (Beyond Minimum Viable Product) gave us a takeaway that was never over fascinating at the last minute because we were supposed to make our final touches days before its due date. However, we were still able to make our website more visual, interactive, with a high quality of brain illustration for our background which is much better than before. Therefore, it is always better to never give up even at the last minute by using that 15 minutes wisely to improve with feedback from our classmates which they comment that it wasn't any new website so they recommended us to add more features to make it a little bit unique than before.


###### Expo elevator pitch, and in-class presentation

My challenge was not learning from my failure when our product and website was still lacking attractive features so we had trouble with collaboration during both the class and in the expo to explain why our BMVP was not attractive as others. Also, during presentation we were not ready for random choice from Mr.Mueller in order to explain our challenges with Babylon and how it all intersects with our takeaways since it was pretty difficult to intersect Babylon with Java or anything in between since Babylon is completely different tool with combination of different features and textures.

Takeaways: Finally,I had connection between my partner and I but we had trouble learning from our mistakes and prioritizing time in order to practice our presentation along with doing our BMVP on time in both the class and in expo. However, this taught us to never give up by doing our assigned tasks no matter what happens to make our product and website attractive which we did. Therefore, communication and collaboration is a key to success by disguising our challenges and linking them back to our takeaways during all of our presentations. Supporting each other and never giving up at any point clearly helped us to combine our mistakes in order to come up with solutions which successfully resulted in our goal along with making our friendship even stronger than before through BMVP.

### Engineering Design Process

I am so proud of myself for being on the final step of the process but I am still in the process of communicating my results by thinking of skills I've learned from BMVP. Since we finished our presentation I still look forward to sharing my product and website with my peers on the 2026 channel on Slack in order to gather feedback for my APCSP and my future projects. These feedbacks are definitely going to teach me a skill by telling how I can fix my mistakes which would be helpful for my senior year, general life, and college. Since I look forward to showing this project to my college application and I want to major in medicine, there is a huge connection between my future goals and my BMVP of 2025. Therefore, adding attractive features and textures to our product and website is still in motion because we want to communicate our results of BMVP of 2025 in order to make our simulation even better to show it off to college and to our families. Communicating our results is significant as it helps me to plan my future goals by seeing how good I am right now and how I can improve myself in the future by thinking of what prophets I look forward to completing along with how I will achieve live and animated simulation with my partner.

### Skills: Embracing failure & Time management
I gained skill of embracing failure which basically means rather than being discouraged by a bug or an error message, we love mistakes because they help us learn. My mistake of over procrastinating our product by not adding attractive features earlier, I learned to embrace my failure by promising myself to never do this again and to never give up no matter what. Also, it was my fault for not practicing my and my partners challenges and how it all intersects with our takeaways so I learned to always have a practice before our failure in order to have successful presentation during both the class and in expo. By doing this, we were able to get 100/100 on our presentation and BMVP so I am always proud of making mistakes instead of being embarrassed of them since everything I fail in SEP had a purpose of looking forward to not repeating the same step for next year (APCSP). Therefore, mistakes are always a key to success especially during partnership because we were able to tell what we have to improve for our product and presentation so we took notes on posts to remind ourselves of what we should say and what we should avoid during our presentation.  I will continue to use this skill to decide further tasks in my AP Biology class since we also have presentation so I will practice my notes and record myself along with improving anything I need to before its deadline in order to not repeat my failure or mistakes over again but I am never embarrassed of my mistakes since I also have an opportunity to fail during project.

Another skill I was able to reflect on is Time Management which basically means to prioritizing and scheduling tasks, working towards an BMVP. There was a lot going on during presentation planning along with presentation topics, final touches to our product & website, AP Biology Meghan Project presentation, AP Lang Exam, and general life so this skill helped me to balance everything even though I did it in last minute, I was still able to manage my time by not giving up and looking forward to a success. By doing this, I was able to intersect this skill of time management into my personal life of babysitting, cooking, classes, and family trips along with movie time with my friends. Ability to manage time in order to balance my academics, extracurricular activities, and personal life is also a key to success because this shows professionalism in responsibility throughout my lifetime. I managed my time by taking a few notes and discussing the presentation, our product, simulation, website, and in class expo with my partner which still helped me a bit even though I was not able to do everything on time but I still did it with perseverance, persistence, and time management ability. Therefore, I am proud of myself for gaining this skill which helped me to gain knowledge of balancing everything without giving up and keeping up with unrelated process of Effective researching has helped me become knowledgeable on these topics through the related process of academics, extracurricular activities, and personal lifeI used from an unrelated class. I will continue to use this skill to conduct further responsibilities by balancing everything in my academic and personal aspect of my life just like I did it for this experience of BMVP with my partner.

### Reflection

As a result, I am pretty proud of myself and my best friend (partner, Michaela) for successfully completing BMVP for the lack of technologies in medicine without relying on existing technologies and others. Therefore, I am proud to bring a new existing simulation for technologies of medicine and serve positive impacts both on my community and my future with my partner. Additionally, We look forward to using everything I learned along with new skills for my general life and college.
