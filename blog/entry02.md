### How I have been tinkering with Babylon and my plans for Winter Recess

#### During the past weeks, I have been improving my knowledge of Babylon by learning more and more through tinkering. Specifically, I have learned functions of shapes and playground like parameters, positions, etc,. and how to create unique house using Babylon. I went to [Babylon website](https://www.babylonjs.com/) and chose document or code to tinker with like shapes, playground, and house. I was confused about purpose of certain codes and funcion so I changed them to see how my result would change in order to learn what those functions does such as parameters, positions, etc,.
