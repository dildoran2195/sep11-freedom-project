# Tool Learning Log

## 11/12
#### I used [Babylon](https://www.babylonjs.com/), went to Tools and chose [a playground](https://playground.babylonjs.com/) to tinker with. I wondered what would happen if I change 0.7 of light density of 0.11 because I wasn´t sure of what light density is and after i did that I learned light density is the amount of color in a playground that has only a sphere. I didn't like the shape of the sphere because it was so common so I used this code 

```

// Our built-in 'goldenberg' shape. var sphere = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateGoldberg("Goldenberg", {diameter: 2, segments: 32}, scene); // Move the goldenberg upward 1/2 its height sphere.position.y = 1;

```

#### This code changed the shape of sphere to Goldenberg (name of the shape).

#### To create the shape of Goldenberg because it´s name was just fancy. 

#### In the future, I wish to work with numbers and learn more of new shapes on a sandbox on [Babylon website](https://www.babylonjs.com/) that I don´t know of yet.

### 18/24:
* I went to [Babylon.js website](https://www.babylonjs.com/). I wanted to tinker with height,weight,etc in babylon.

### After:
This is how I tinker with playground to learn more about positioning and after how playground looked like.

*  // Default intensity is 1. Let's dim the light a small amount
    light.intensity = 0.5;

    // Our built-in 'sphere' shape.
    var sphere = BABYLON.MeshBui!
lder.CreateSphere("sphere", {diameter: 5, segments: 50}, scene);

    // Move the sphere upward 1/2 its height
    sphere.position.y = 2;

#### I learned that light.density changed how shape is showen, either dark or light and I increased light.density. Diameter is width and segmnet is like size of the shape. sphere.position is where the shape is located.

Before:
// Default intensity is 1. Let's dim the light a small amount
    light.intensity = 0.7;

    // Our built-in 'sphere' shape.
    var sphere = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateSphere("sphere", {diameter: 2, segments: 32}, scene);

    // Move the sphere upward 1/2 its height
    sphere.position.y = 1;
